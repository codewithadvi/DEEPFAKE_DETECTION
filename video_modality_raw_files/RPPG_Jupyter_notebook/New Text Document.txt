🎯 GOAL:
Build a modular Flask backend for deepfake detection (starting with video), where:

The main app connects to the frontend and receives a video file.

It dispatches the video to a video processor module.

The video processor runs multiple deepfake detection models in parallel threads:

RPPG (remote photoplethysmography)

Lip Sync

Face Feature Consistency

Each model returns:

label: "real" or "fake"

confidence: float

reason: textual explanation

The aggregated output is sent back to the frontend.

🔁 Workflow (Current Phase - Video Only):

Frontend sends video via /api/video POST request.

video_controller.py receives it and saves the file.

Calls video_processor.process_video(video_path)

Inside video_processor.py, spawns 3 threads:

Calls rppg_model.rppg_process()

Calls lipsync_model.lipsync_process()

Calls face_features_model.face_features_process()

Waits for threads to complete.

Aggregates results into a single JSON and returns to frontend.

🛠 Each model returns:

json
Copy code
{
  "label": "fake",
  "confidence": 0.92,
  "reason": "Heart rate inconsistent across frames"
}
📅 FUTURE PLANS (After Video Works):

Add support for:

/api/image

/api/audio

/api/text

Implement multimodal fusion logic for final decision.

Add logging, error handling, and caching.

Let me know when you're ready to start building and I’ll help scaffold the code.
